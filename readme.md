# Survey of the Incarcerated
Monolith, voices silenced, not heard, very little is known about the views of the incarcerated population.

Beginning in the winter of 2019, The Marshall Project/Slate undertook a large reporting project to survey the political views of incarcerated people in American prisons and jails. The survey was carried out through collaboration with tablet companies serving some facilities, as well as in paper form through News Inside, The Marshall Project's print publication distributed inside some facilities. 

After collecting responses on a rolling basis for several months, by March of 2020 over 8,000 survey responses had arrived from incarcerated people across the country. Marshall Project/Slate reporters analyzed that data and reported findings in a series of stories published in March. 

This repository contains a cleaned, formatted and anonymized version of that raw survey data. 

# Limitations
Due to the difficulty of accessing incarcerated populations, it was not feasible to reliably reach and survey all facilities, geographic areas, and demographic groups in the United States. The Marshall Project/Slate took efforts to reach as many respondents as feasible, and worked to carefully analyze demographic and personal information supplied by respondents to attempt to control for broad factors when interpreting results of the data; however, this survey should in no way be considered a representative picture of the entire incarcerated population of the United States, and any further interpretation of this public data should be done with similar caution. 

# Timeline
Survey collection is ongoing; this public data is a snapshot of what the team had collected as of March 2020.

# Files
*data/incarcerated_survey_responses-marshallproject_slate-march_11_2019.csv* contains the cleaned and anonymized survey responses data
*data/incarcerated_survey_questions-marshallproject_slate-march_11_2019.csv* contains a matching from the short-form question descriptors used in the column names of the responses data, and the longer question texts used in the survey. Sometimes question texts are slightly expanded to fully clarify the question with context, for instance in the case of multiple choice questions.
